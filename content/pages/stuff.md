### Self-hosting and other computer stuff
As you may have guessed from the existence of this website, I am fairly tech-minded. 
I love tinkering with computers and software. Somehow, I've picked up the hobby of [self-hosting
things](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/index), meaning I try to run services on my
own computers, instead of using some online service. For instance, instead of using a Dropbox account,
I have a [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) in my living room which gives 
me access to my files. In fact, this website used to be hosted on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). 
I now switched to a [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (i.e., someone
else's PC), because there is less chance this website goes down when I do something stupid. The VPS 
hosts this website, plus some other services.  The raspberry is still at home, quitly sitting in the back of
a cupboard, running even more services. These other 'services' are stuff like a personal wiki, an 
personal online cookbook, a git server, etc.. Of course these things are all very usefull, but I could
have just used a (free) online service for that. The reason I host these myself is because it gives
me a little better control over my data, and, maybe even more importantly, I enjoy the setting-up and 
playing with these things.

I have never received much training (apart from a 6ects "Programming in Python" course in my BSc), 
so I am mostly self-thought. I am not sure how (or why) this started, but it made for a good COVID 
induced hobby. If you want to know more about this or see an overview of all my services and how they
work, you can take a look [here]({filename}hobbies/selfhosting.md).

### Rowing
If I feel more like doing something active, in the weekends I like to go [rowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)) 
on the Amstel river.

### Hiking
I also really like hiking. I live close to one of the scattered little pieces of nature that remain 
in The Netherlands. This is great, since we can just start walking 
from our home, or bike 20 minutes to the closest starting spot. 

A feature that is sorely lacking in the Netherlands is - of course - hills and mountains. Unsurprisingly,
our holidays are usually centered around going hiking up a bunch of hills or mountains somewhere. 
We mainly stay in Europe; Scotland, Austria, and Switzerland are personal favourites, although we are
still young, so more destinations will undoubtably follow.

Sort of related to that, we love to travel by train. Trains *feel* much
more adventurous then planes, even if they aren't really. And of course trains are better for the enviroment.

### Reading
Finally, I enjoy reading. People often ask me what kind of books I read. I like all kinds of 
books. Often, I go trough phases. Is switch from detectives to science fiction, then from 
Dutch literature to fantasy, and from American classics to non-fiction. For some reason, 
people never like this answer, but it is what it is.
