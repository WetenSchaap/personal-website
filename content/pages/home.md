Title: Hi!

Welcome! I am Piet, a PhD student at the university of Amsterdam. If you are not me
I am not entirely sure how you found this website, but hey, if I did
not want random people visiting this website, I shouldn't have put it 
on the internet. The [about me]({filename}about-me.md) section is probably
the right place to start.

You will find that many of the links in the sidebar are not
accessible without a password. This is because they link to services
that are for my personal use, like a small wiki, a git server, and more.
