Title: Hi!

Welcome! I am Piet, a PhD student at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) 
in experimental Soft Matter physics. I am doing research in the 
[soft condensed matter group](https://iop.fnwi.uva.nl/scm/), under the supervision of 
[prof. Peter Schall](https://peterschall.de/). More specifically, I work on the self-assembly
of patchy colloidal particles into all kinds of interesting things. If you want to know more 
about that, check [this page]({filename}/pages/research.md).

In my free time, I spent time hiking (in the dunes during most of the year, in the
mountains during hollidays), rowing (on the Amstel river) and reading. finally, I like toying 
with computers. That at least sort of explains the existence of this website. Read more
about that [here]({filename}/pages/stuff.md).

You will find that many of the links in the sidebar are not
accessible without a password or other authentication. This is because they link to services
that are for my personal use, like a small wiki, a recipe book, and a photo gallery.
