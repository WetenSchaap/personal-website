# Hi!
Welcome! I am Piet Swinkels. If you are not me
I am not entirely sure how you found this website, but hey, if I did
not want random people visiting this website, I shouldn't have put it 
on the internet. Again, welcome, look around, click some links!

You will find that quite a few of the links in the sidebar are not
accessible without a password. This is on purpose. Most of these links
are personsl, like a wiki with setup instructions for
this website (and more), a personal git server, and access to my NAS.
