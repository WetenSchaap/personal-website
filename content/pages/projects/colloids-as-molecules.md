Colloidal particles offer fascinating insight into the statistical mechanics and assembly behaviour of atoms. 
The particles, about a micrometer in size, have thermal energy and attractive/repulsive interactions similar to atoms,
making them form phases very similar to their atomic counterpart. Yet, due to their larger size, they can be easily 
observed by optical microscopy. Besides being atomic models, these particles serve as building blocks for the assembly 
of new micro- and nanoscale materials, for instance in photonics and optoelectronics (solar panels).

We bind “patchy” colloidal particles into colloidal molecules using critical Casimir interactions. The attractive
critical Casimir force arises only between the patches, from the confinement of critical solvent fluctuations between them.
the movie below shows a pair of tetrapatch particles (particles with four patches in tetragonal coordination) clearly bonded 
via one of their patches (bright). These tetrapatch particles form structures known from molecular carbon (in sp³ hybradization),
such as alkanes and more complex molecules, see figure below. Because we can follow these colloidal molecules directly in real 
space and time, we obtain unique insight into their atomic counterpart, dynamics and transition states. We analyse their vibration 
spectrum, conformations and relaxation, and how this depends on the patch attraction, which we can vary continuously.

Colloids with directed interactions assemble into colloidal molecules, with structures mimicking that of atomic molecules. The 
figure shows colloidal molecules assembled from di- and tetrapatch colloidal particles. Optical microscopy images are shown on 
the left, and their molecular analogues on the right. These particles form molecular compounds known from organic chemistry, 
and because of their size can be directly observed at the particle scale by microscopy. Furthermore, their three-dimensional 
structure and dynamics is conveniently observed. As the colloidal molecule is in a highly thermally excited state, where quantum 
mechanical states become quasi continuous, it corresponds to the classical limit of its atomic counterpart, and as such presents 
a good model of the actual molecule.
