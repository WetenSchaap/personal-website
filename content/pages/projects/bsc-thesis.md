I performed my BSc thesis in 2015 under supervision of [Joris Sprakel](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Su9JOb8AAAAJ) and [Jasper van der Gucht](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=ajwWs2wAAAAJ) in the [Physical Chemistry and Soft Matter group](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Agrotechnology-and-Food-Sciences/Physical-Chemistry-and-Soft-Matter.htm) at Wageningen University. 

In this project, I looked ad adhesion of the type you also see in gecko's. Not due to a glue, but due to pillars 
interacting with a wall trough vanderwaals forces. Specifically I modelled a situation where we could vary the 
placing of pillars (i.e. randomly placed, concentric, hexagonal, etc.) as well as the elasticity of the substrate
the pillars stood on.
