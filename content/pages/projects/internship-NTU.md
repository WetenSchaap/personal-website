I performed an internship at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore in 2017. I performed this research under supervision of 
[Ali Miserez](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Nb6KgIoAAAAA) and [Bartosz Gabryelczyk](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8150-8353) in 
the [Biological and Biomimetic Materials Laboratory](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ali.miserez/).

In this project, I studied the proteins that couse coacervation inside the beak of giant squids. A [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13469-8
containing my work (and quite a lot of other stuff) was published in Nature Communications if you want to check it out. 

If you want a short(-ish) readable, understandable version of what I did, hopefully understandable for laymen, keep reading! 

## A Squid and its Coacervates
The formation of a water-immiscible liquid through the association of macromolecules, or '[coacervation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coacervate)', is ubiquitous in the natural world. 
It is present at all length scales: from adhesives used by marine animals, like barnacles and sandcastle worms, to the formation of 
membraneless organelles, and the packing of DNA in the cell. In this project, I studied the coacervates and related structures found in 
the beak of the *Dosidicus gigas* squid.

The squid beak has fascinating mechanical properties: the beak is extremely strong: strong enough to penetrate the shells of [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean)
it feeds on. On top of this, from the beak base to the hard tip (the 'rostrum') a 200-fold stiffness gradient is found. The 'classic' approach
to building though materials in nature is the use of minerals. However, the squid makes use of another system altogether: the strength and 
gradient of the material are a result of the infiltration of the [chitinous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin) 'framework' of the beak with a network formed by proteins. 
The beak base is highly hydrated, and has a low protein content, while the rostrum is almost completely dehydrated, and has a high protein content.
	
Biomolecular gradients, like the one found in squid beak are efficient at mitigating mechanical damage at interfaces. Failures in engineering 
multicomponent systems are often due to mechanical property mismatches between various components. Therefore, natures solution for mitigating mismatch 
problems can potentially improve multicomponent system durability. For example, prosthetic limbs set directly in bone can benefit from a transition zone 
from soft tissue to the titanium prosthetic.
	
On top of this, coacervates have attracted attention, due to their potential in biomedical applications as [drug carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_carrier)
or [contrast agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_agent). A better fundamental understanding in the different driving forces underlying coacervation
is essential to design and improve these carriers, their biocompatibility and their responsiveness.
	
On closer inspection, the coacervates found in squid beak are not always truly coacervates. The proteins sometimes self-assemble into a hydrogel-like 
[fibrillar network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibril). The self assembly of proteins is relevant, as they could be used to built new functional materials. 
Protein fibrils in particular are the subject of intense study, because a class of protein fibrils ('[amyloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid)') 
are involved in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Other examples of protein fibre include spider silk.

## How does the squid get nice coacervates

In this work, I studied the 'DgHBP' protein to explain its self-coacervating and self-assembling behaviour. I specifically studied 2 types of DgHBP
proteint which look largely the same. However, their self-coacervating behaviour is different. In seawater, one will form a 'dispersed coacervate' 
- the solution will turn milky white due to the phase separation of the solution into a protein-poor phase and protein-rich microscopic droplets. The droplets
will sediment into a single macroscopic coacervate phase at long time scales. The other will produce a 'fibrillar network' - a hydrogel-like 
substance. 

In this project, I tried to show that the proteins that cause coacervation or a fibrillar network consist all contain a set of standard motifs. 
These parts of the proteins are clearly nessecary for making coacervates, while the rest seems less interesting. These motifs are repeated a few
times within the protein. If you build new, small proteins that only contain these repeats (and very little other things), they can still make 
coacervates. Therefore, if you know if this repeating motif is present in the protein, and how many times, you can pretty accuratly predict what the behaviour
of the protein is going to be. The parts of the protein outside of these repeating motifes seem to be more filler than anything else. In fact, the entire
protein seems pretty unstructured, which is atypical for a protein.

This finding is nice, because it means we can look at at different proteins in different species, and predict if the proteins are also going to form coacervates.
On top of that, we may want to start designing our own coacervate proteins, as they are quite interesting materials to have at your disposal.
