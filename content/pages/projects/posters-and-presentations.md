2D materials have attracted great interest in the past decades. Graphene, for instance, has many exotic mechanical and electronic properties that are not typically found in bulk materials. Unfortunately commercial production is not yet possible: the assembly of these materials remains hard to study, as direct observation is often challenging or impossible. However, by using patchy particles, we can mimic atomic 2D structures using colloids, which can be studied in real time using optical microscopy.

Here, we use 4-patch particles with a tetrahedral geometry together with critical Casimir forces to build a 2D material. We adsorb one of the particle patches to the cover glass so that particles can diffuse laterally, but cannot release from the surface. The three remaining, triangularly coordinated patches bond with those of other particles. We have thus created a system of particles that are effectively trivalent, and are confined to a 2D plane, much like the carbon atoms in graphene.

Using this colloidal system, we observe the formation of honeycomb-like crystal structures in real time with optical microscopy, and investigate their assembly as well as structural phase transitions. Interestingly, at finite patch width and bond angles, the phase diagram is much richer than the honeycomb crystal structure alone. Our observations, which are in good agreement with simulation predictions, provide detailed insight into the assembly of graphene, and 2D materials in general.

Poster: [Colloidal Molecules: Assembling Patchy Particles into Colloidal Superstructures]({static}/pdfs/posters/poster_physics-at-veldhoven_2020.pdf)

Colloids have a rich history of being used as _big atoms_, to study phase transitions such as crystallization, gelation and the glass transition of condensed matter. Recent advances in colloid chemistry now allow patchy particles to be made with good accuracy, enabling us to build analogs of chemical compounds. Of particular interest here are tetramer particles mimicking carbon atoms. We study the assembly of such tetramer particles with tetrahedral bond angles, identical to the bond angles of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms. We observe that these particles assemble into a wealth of carbon compound analogs, most notably _colloidal_ cyclopentane, consisting of 5 patchy particles. Interestingly, this colloidal cyclopentane exhibits the known configurations of its atomic counterpart, forming envelope and twist conformations. We follow their dynamics and dynamic transitions directly in three dimensions using confocal microscopy.

Molecular assembly is a good inspiration for the design of colloids for complex superstructures. From simple atomic properties, like direction, valency and reversibility, atoms can spontaneously form many different structures, from rings to polymers, and from diamond crystals to glasses. The reverse is also true: the assembly of colloids with atom-like properties may grant us new insight into the behaviour of molecules
