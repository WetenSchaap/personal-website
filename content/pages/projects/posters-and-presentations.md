2D materials have attracted great interest in the past decades. Graphene, for instance, has many exotic mechanical and electronic properties that are not typically found in bulk materials. Unfortunately commercial production is not yet possible: the assembly of these materials remains hard to study, as direct observation is often challenging or impossible. However, by using patchy particles, we can mimic atomic 2D structures using colloids, which can be studied in real time using optical microscopy.

Here, we use 4-patch particles with a tetrahedral geometry together with critical Casimir forces to build a 2D material. We adsorb one of the particle patches to the cover glass so that particles can diffuse laterally, but cannot release from the surface. The three remaining, triangularly coordinated patches bond with those of other particles. We have thus created a system of particles that are effectively trivalent, and are confined to a 2D plane, much like the carbon atoms in graphene.

Using this colloidal system, we observe the formation of honeycomb-like crystal structures in real time with optical microscopy, and investigate their assembly as well as structural phase transitions. Interestingly, at finite patch width and bond angles, the phase diagram is much richer than the honeycomb crystal structure alone. Our observations, which are in good agreement with simulation predictions, provide detailed insight into the assembly of graphene, and 2D materials in general.
