Hi! I am Piet Swinkels. At the time of writing I work at the
[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) as a PhD student in experimental
Soft Matter physics. I am doing this in the [soft condensed matter group](https://iop.fnwi.uva.nl/scm/)
, under the supervision of [prof. Peter Schall](https://peterschall.de/). You can find
 more about my research on [this]({filename}/pages/research.md) page.

## Self-hosting and other computer stuff
As you may have guessed from the existence of this website, I am fairly tech-minded. 
I love tinkering with computers and software. In fact, this website is hosted on a
[Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), which is quitly sitting in the back of
a cupboard somewhere in my house. As you may or may not have seen in the sidebar, it also
runs quite a few other services. Of course these can all be usefull, but in reality, 
I enjoy the setting-up and playing around more then the actual using of those services.
(Before you ask, yes, I also used to play with Lego.) I have never received much training
(apart from a 6ects "Programming in Python" course in my BSc), so I am mostly self-thought.
I am not sure how (or why) this started, but I enjoy it so I don't think about it too much.
An overview of all my services and how they work can be found [here]({filename}hobbies/selfhosting.md). 
That page exist mostly to get thing straight for myself, but if you are particularily 
interested, you can always take a look.

## Hiking and travel
Appart from playing with computers I also really like hiking. I live close to one of the scattered little 
pieces of nature that remain in The Netherlands. This is great, since we can just start walking 
from our home, or bike 20 minutes to the closest starting spot. 

A feature that is sorely lacking in the Netherlands is - of course - hills and mountains. Unsurprisingly,
our holidays are usually centered around going hiking up a bunch of hills or mountains somewhere. 
We mainly stay in Europe; Schotland, Austria, Switzerland are personal favourites, although we are
still young, so more destinations will undoubtably follow.

Sort of related to that, we love to travel by train. As we are still young, we can use (relatively) cheap 
Interrail tickets to travel Europe, and the train is just a bit more romantic than an airplane. Trains *feel* much
more adventurous then planes, even if they aren't really. And of course trains are better for the enviroment.

## Reading
Finally, I enjoy reading. People often ask me what kind of books I read. I like all kinds of 
books. Often, I go trough phases. Is switch from detectives to science fiction, then from 
Dutch literature to fantasy, and from American classics to non-fiction. For some reason, 
people never like this answer, but it is what it is.
