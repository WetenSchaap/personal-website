My research is in the field of [Soft Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter),
the science of soft things (basically). If you want to know more about that, the wikipedia 
is a pretty good place to start reading.

More specifically, I am currently investigating the assembly and mechanics of complex
colloidal structures made from patchy colloidal particles. [Recent breakthroughs](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23901) in synthesis
allow the design of anisotropic colloidal particles that serve as building blocks in complex
micron and nanoscale structures. These structures are both of fundamental scientific interest
as well as important for applications in future smart materials. I explore the
physics of patchy particle  assembly, and hopefully, eventually the resulting mechanical properties. 
This provides fundamental insight into complex self-assembly processes and mechanical response at the
micron- and nanoscale for tomorrowâ€™s materials, and elucidate principles that also underlie
complex biological structures.
