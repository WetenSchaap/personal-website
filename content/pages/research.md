My research is in the field of [Soft Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter), the science of (basically) soft things. If you want to know more about that, the wikipedia is a pretty good place to start reading.

More specifically, I am currently investigating so-called *Patchy Particles* and study their assembly behaviour. We see how particles assemble, into what kind of structures, and try to learn the rules of this type of assembly, which may be at the base of future complex materials with interesting mechanical or optical properties.
