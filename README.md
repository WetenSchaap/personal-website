# personal-website
This project contains the Pelican code that is the basis of my personal website. You should find the website [here](https://www.swnkls.com), 
at least if I did not lose interest in maintaining it. It is all *very* simple, but that's why its nice I guess.

For this to work, the folder with my theme `../pelican-themes/Flex` must exist. As you may guess from that, I make use of the  [Flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) (with some minor [adaptations](https://github.com/WetenSchaap/Flex)).
