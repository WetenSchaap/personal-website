<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Piet Swinkels. At the time of writing I work at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a> as a PhD student in Soft Matter physics. I am doing this in the <a href="https://iop.fnwi.uva.nl/scm/">soft condensed matter group</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://peterschall.de/">prof. Peter Schall</a>. You can find more about my research at <a href="/pages/research.html">this</a> page.</p>
<h2>Computer tinkering</h2>
<p>As you may have guessed from the existence of this website, I am fairly tech-minded. I love tinkering with computers and software. In fact, this website is hosted on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>, which is quitly sitting in the back of a cupboard somewhere in my house. As you may or may not have seen in the sidebar, it also runs quite a few other services. Of course these can all be usefull, but in reality, I enjoy the setting-up and playing around more then the actual using of those services. (Before you ask, yes, I also used to play with Lego.) I have never received much training (apart from a 6ects "Programming in Python" course in my BSc), so I am mostly self-thought. I am not sure how (or why) this started, but I enjoy it so I don't think about it too much.</p>
<h2>Walking</h2>
<p>Appart from playing with computers I also really like hiking. I am not a great adventurer, but me and my girfriend try to visit mountains at least once per year to just walk around. We love to go by train. As we are still young, we can use (relatively) cheap Interrail tickets to travel Europe, and the train is just a bit more romantic than an airplane. Trains <em>feel</em> much more adventurous then planes, even if they aren't really.
Closer to home, we live near the <a href="https://www.np-zuidkennemerland.nl/">Kennemerduinen</a>, so we often go for walks there.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Finally, I enjoy reading. People often ask me what kind of books I read. I like all kinds of books. Often, I go trough phases. Is switch from detectives to science fiction, then from Dutch literature to fantasy, and from American classics to non-fiction. For some reason, people never like this answer, but it is what it is. </p>  </div>
